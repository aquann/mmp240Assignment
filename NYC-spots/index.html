            <p>These four attractions are the most well known places to go to in New York City. From the theme park by the beach to the quaint trail in the city, and two of the best palces to learn from while having fun. All these places are relatively cheap to visit and have no age perference making great for anyone to come by. Luna Park is great for the kids, The Highline is a wonderful trail for a short excursion, and The Guggenheim/Metropolitan Museum are wonderful to quinch your thirst for knowledge.</p>
